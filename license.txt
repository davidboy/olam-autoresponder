No warranty of any kind is implied or expressed. You're also
liable for your own actions with this script. If something 
goes wrong, it's your fault and you get to deal with the 
consequences. I'm not going to pay for it.

I will be updating this software as time goes on, if you want
the newest version... that's where you need to go.

This script is released under the GPL, provided as gpl.txt.

The GPL requires that you maintain proper credit (the image
at the bottom and links in the unsubscribe messages) and that
any changes you make be redistributed. You can post code 
changes to the forum or send them to me via email, I'll repost
them for others. Removing the "powered by" and credit links 
without an alternate license may effect your ability to receive
support in the forums.

Some plugins (namely tinyMCE) operate under a different license.
TinyMCE, written by Moxiecode at http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/
is an open source LGPL html editor. It's seperately licensed 
and any changes you make specifically to it may require 
something different.

There are, however, some situations where the GPL isn't the 
perfect option. If you have clients and need to rebrand the 
script to fit their site, or if you want to operate w/o the 
image footer or links in the unsub message. We offer additional
licensing capabilities that can allow you to rebrand and make
changes w/o redistribution. These also usually include free
email support for up to a year, too, so they're generally worth
it. Check our website at http://infinite.ibasics.biz for more 
information about alternate licensing options.

These alternate licenses cannot expand to cover TinyMCE (or any
other plugin) however. If you need a license specifically for 
that you can get one at http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/ that 
will cover your needs. You can also disable tinyMCE via the 
config screen if this becomes a problem for you.
